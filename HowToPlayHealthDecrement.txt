Notes
	Oh No! our hero is taking damage! There are many different attacks chipping health off our hero.
	It's our job to save him. In fact, let's use the old adage, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"
	and increase his health each time the enemy strikes!
	
Goal:
	Use CheatEngine to...
	Find the health variable, and the associated function(s) that affect our health.
	change the sub <reg> <val> assembly to add <reg> <val>
	This is "reverse" engineering after all...
