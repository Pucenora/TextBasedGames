# TextBasedGames
Various "simple" games that are console based

The idea behind most of these games is to either outsmart the AI (Nim) 
or use CheatEngine to find the memory location of the integers that represent
health, and the corresponding function that decreases health.
The player has won when the hero increases health rather than looses it each iteration.

For several games, it is possible to win without cheating. For others, the player needs
to be able to access memory of the running program, or even change the assembly of the decrement function.
So far, this has only been tested on windows. However, the code is open to all to use, reuse, modify, extend.
